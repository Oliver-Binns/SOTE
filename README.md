# Software Testing

Open Assessment for Software Testing module.
This module was worth ten credits as part of my Master's Year.

The assessment brief is to create a Test Plan, Specifications, analyse the results and produce a summary report.

The software to be tested is the [MASON Simulation Toolkit](https://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason/#Screenshots).
The source for this software will need to be cloned into the "Testing" directory of this repository for the automated tests to be run.
The scope of the testing only needs to cover the following packages:
* sim.engine
* sim.field
* sim.field.grid
